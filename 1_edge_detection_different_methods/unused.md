 
    Zero Crossing Detection:
        Detects edges by locating zero crossings in the second derivative of the image intensity. This method is often used in conjunction with other edge detection techniques like LoG.

    Edge Filters:
        Various specialized filters designed to enhance specific types of edges or features in an image. Examples include the Marr-Hildreth edge detector, which combines Gaussian smoothing and Laplacian operator, and the Roberts Cross operator, which computes gradients using a pair of simple 2x2 convolution kernels.

    Deep Learning-based Methods:
        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been increasingly used for edge detection tasks. CNNs can learn to detect edges and features directly from image data through training on labeled datasets. Architectures like U-Net, FCN, and SegNet have been applied to edge detection and semantic segmentation tasks with promising results.
